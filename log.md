# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Object Oriented Programming and practised basic Algorithm Scripting on #freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Struggled with some of the Algorithm Scripting challenges whilst feeling tired this evening. OOP content was easy to understand and complete tasks.
