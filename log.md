# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Object Oriented Programming and practised basic Algorithm Scripting on #freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Struggled with some of the Algorithm Scripting challenges whilst feeling tired this evening. OOP content was easy to understand and complete tasks.

### Day 2: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started php for beginners on @laracasts and continued with JS algorithms problem solving

**Thoughts:** I wanted to try working with php for the backend of all my projects, however I realised whilst easier to learn to syntax as I've already covered the basics in JavaScript, ultimately starting to learn php  is going to slow down my progress in learning the fundementals.

### Day 3: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began work on TheOdinProject's fullstack javascript course. completed the basis of my rock-paper-scissor game.

**Thoughts:** Working on the rock-paper-scissor game was fun, as this was a challenge I first attempted when I began to learn javscript around 3 months ago. Coming back to the challenge now and I was easily able to structure the program much quicker than before. I did get stuck on an issue to do with control, however I decided to come back to the issue a day later and was easily able to now solve the issue.
