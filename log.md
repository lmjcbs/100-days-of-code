# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Object Oriented Programming and practised basic Algorithm Scripting on #freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Struggled with some of the Algorithm Scripting challenges whilst feeling tired this evening. OOP content was easy to understand and complete tasks.

### Day 2: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started php for beginners on @laracasts and continued with JS algorithms problem solving

**Thoughts:** I wanted to try working with php for the backend of all my projects, however I realised whilst easier to learn to syntax as I've already covered the basics in JavaScript, ultimately starting to learn php  is going to slow down my progress in learning the fundementals.

### Day 3: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began work on TheOdinProject's fullstack javascript course. completed the basis of my rock-paper-scissor game.

**Thoughts:** Working on the rock-paper-scissor game was fun, as this was a challenge I first attempted when I began to learn javscript around 3 months ago. Coming back to the challenge now and I was easily able to structure the program much quicker than before. I did get stuck on an issue to do with control, however I decided to come back to the issue a day later and was easily able to now solve the issue.

### Day 4: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on TheOdinProject's fullstack javascript course. Worked through the webdev fundementals 4 exercises and completed them all.

**Thoughts:** Through working on the exercises, I got exposure to javascript unit testing with jasmine. Learned how to setup jasmine and test my code using pre-written tests. This helped make me aware of making sure that functions I write work in different conditions and when non expected arguments are passed through.

### Day 5: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Played around with the DOM, adding some interactivity to previous projects and learned about regular expressions on #freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Found the DOM work quite challenging. Will need to work some more on it.

### Day 6: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished up work on my rock paper scissors project. Decided to refactor my code and go over it step-by-step, deciding what was really needed and what wasn't. Also learned how to push a project online using Github Pages.

**Thoughts:** Although refacotring my code was a useful exercise, I found it difficult to do as much as I had hoped, as I feel as if I coded the project to the best of ability already, making it hard to see obvious improvements. I talked to the people on Discord and told me that it's not so much about finding the optimal solution, but cutting out unused code or finding a simpler way to explain things would be better. Using this advice and also taking a look at other student's completed projected helped give me some fresh inspiration.
